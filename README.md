ChronoCanvas

React JS , GSAP , Tailwind

ChronoCanvas is a web application where users can create, visualize, and interact with personal or project-based timelines. It's a digital canvas where points in time (events, milestones) are plotted visually, allowing for exploration, organization, and easy comprehension of chronological data. Think of it as a personal history tracker, project planner, or even a mini-genealogy viewer, all presented as a dynamic, zoomable timeline.
